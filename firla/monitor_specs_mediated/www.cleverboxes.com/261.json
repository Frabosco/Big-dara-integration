    "description": "With true 1920 x 1080p resolution your monitor is ready to display high definition images. This means you can accommodate more information on your screen; e.g. 60% more in comparison to a 1280 x 1024 monitor. HDMI stands for High-Definition Multimedia Interface. Much smaller and more convenient than DVI, HDMI also has the significant advantage over DVI that it supports audio as well as video signals. This LED monitor is equipped with two high quality stereo speakers. VESA mount compliance means you can easily mount your monitor to a wall. When very fast graphics are displayed your monitor can sometimes get blurry. Turning on the OverDrive feature will eliminate that. All iiyama monitors are compatible with Apple-Macintosh computers.",
